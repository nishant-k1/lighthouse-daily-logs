## ⚡ Notes & Learnings

- `Authorization` header was missing in some API requests, causing token failures.
- Implemented `useRef` + `setTimeout` for a better debounce mechanism.

## 🔄 Blockers & Next Steps

- Waiting for backend team confirmation on new API headers.
- Complete debounce implementation & test performance.
